# Contributing to typst-world

## Code Style

All clippy lints are set to `deny` level — the project will not compile with violations.

Key restrictions:
- No `unwrap()` — use `?` operator or `anyhow`/`thiserror` error handling
- No `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, `unreachable!()` — handle all cases
- No `unsafe` code
- No wildcard imports (`use foo::*`)
- No single-character variable names (minimum 2 characters)
- Functions: max 70 lines, max 5 arguments, max cognitive complexity 20

## Error Handling

- Use `thiserror::Error` for library error types that callers will match on
- Propagate errors with `?` — never `unwrap()` or `expect()`

## Project Structure

All logic belongs in `lib.rs` (and its modules). Keep the public API surface small and
documented; anything callers depend on should have a doc comment with a `# Errors` section
where relevant.

## Testing

- Unit tests live inline in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block next to the code they exercise.
- Integration tests that exercise the public API across modules live in `tests/`.
- Run the full suite with `just test`.
- `just check` runs clippy and tests twice — once with default features (what
  ships) and once with `--all-features` (`just clippy-all-features` /
  `just test-all-features`), so feature-gated code such as `render` is
  compiled and tested by the primary gate, not just `just cover`. Match that
  locally with `just clippy-all-features` / `just test-all-features` when
  touching anything behind a non-default feature.
- As a file approaches the linecop limit, `just fix-check` ejects its inline
  `#[cfg(test)]` module into a sibling `_tests.rs` file via
  [ejectest](https://github.com/mlavrinenko/ejectest), driven by `linecop --baseline`.
  This keeps source files under the limit without losing the inline-test workflow.

## Code Coverage

Minimum 70% coverage enforced via `cargo-tarpaulin`. Run `just cover` to check.

## CRAP Gate

`just crap` scores each function by the Change Risk Anti-Patterns metric
(cyclomatic complexity weighted by test coverage) and fails above 30. A global
coverage threshold can stay green while one branchy, untested function rots;
CRAP catches that. It reads `target/coverage/lcov.info`, so run `just cover`
first (CI and `just validate` chain them). Fix a flagged function by adding
tests or reducing its branching. Tune the threshold per repo via `--threshold`
or a `.cargo-crap.toml`.

## File Size Limits

- Rust files: 500 lines max
- Markdown files: 200 lines max

When a file exceeds the limit, split it into modules or separate documents.

## Dependency Drift

[outdatty.yaml](outdatty.yaml) declares groups that couple `source` files to the
`dependents` that must stay in sync with them — for example, CLI code to the docs
that describe it. `just check` runs `outdatty check`, which fails when a source
changed but its dependents were not re-confirmed.

After editing a source, review the listed dependents, update them as needed, then
run `just outdatty-update` to record the new state into `outdatty.lock` and commit
it. Add or adjust groups whenever you introduce files that must move together.

## Commit Messages

The backlog lives under `tasks/` as one Typst file per task (see
[mindtape](https://github.com/mlavrinenko/mindtape)). Every commit footer
carries `Refs: <task-slug>` — the task's filename stem, for example
`Refs: gate-the-render-feature-in-just-check` — never the positional id
`mt ls` prints, which is not stable across board edits.

`chore:` commits for tooling, docs hygiene, or repo housekeeping not tied
to a task may omit `Refs:`.

If you don't know which task a change belongs to, ask — don't guess.

## Releasing

Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, give it a dated `CHANGELOG.md` section, commit,
push main and wait for CI. Then run `just release X.Y.Z --dry-run`, and
`just release X.Y.Z` once it passes. The tag push is the only publish path:
never `cargo publish` by hand. A release whose workflow failed is finished on
the same tag with `gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z`; a pushed tag never
moves.

## Submitting Changes

1. Run `just check` before submitting — it runs clippy, tests, file size, and drift checks
2. Run `just fmt` to format code
3. Ensure `just cover` meets the 70% threshold
